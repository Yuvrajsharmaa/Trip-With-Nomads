# Admin Dashboard Project

This is the internal management dashboard for **Trip with Nomads**. It is built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Purpose

The Admin Dashboard is used to:
- Manage Trips and Pricing.
- Monitor Bookings and Payment Statuses.
- Edit CMS content (integrated via Edge Functions/MCP).
- Handle administrative tasks for the TWN platform.

## 📂 Structure

- **`src/`**: The main React source code.
  - `pages/`: Dashboard views (e.g., CMSEditor).
  - `lib/mcp.ts`: Integration with Model Context Protocol for advanced AI assistance.
- **`supabase/`**: Shared backend infrastructure (migrations and Edge Functions).
- **`scripts/`**: Data management and audit scripts.
- **`data/`**: Reference data for trips and pricing.

## 🔗 Dependencies & Context

The dashboard connects directly to the same **Supabase** instance used by the Framer website.
