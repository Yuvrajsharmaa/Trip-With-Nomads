# Working With Yuvraj

## Who You’re Working With
- Yuvraj is a **UX designer** (non-coder).
- Explain in plain language with a medium technical summary.
- Use clear steps; define any jargon briefly.

## Staging-First Workflow
- All features go to **staging** first.
- Promote only after QA.
- Use task scripts in `scripts/ops` (to be created as needed).

## Framer + MCP
- Use **Unframer MCP** to read/write Framer code files.
- Do not override Framer styling unless asked. Keep changes to text/values where possible.
- Ask before touching production.
